# Link to Tax Projection Individual application --> This application is still in process. The link will be posted once it is completed.


## Overview 

I created this application completely from scratch. I had to create the idea, the concept, and the user interface all by myself. There was no tutorial, template, or
boilerplate. I built it based on how a tax accountant and how a programmer think, trying to make the best UI experience for both. This project is impossible for just a tax accountant to build alone and it is impossible for just a programmer to build alone. One must have knowledge of both concepts to create this application.

This project was created to test my front end development skills at the next level. This project is the most complicated project I have attempted to date because of the massive amounts of state needed (REDUX will probably used) and the complexity of the US and NY tax code. Also, as I have built more and more applications there are more and more ideas and techniques to use, expanding my own ability to add more features and increase UI friendliness. I am excited to build this projection as it challenges me yet again.

I plan to use this application to help individuals estimate their quarterly estimated taxes which is its main functionality. The US and NY tax codes are complex and not everyone can afford a high end tax accountant. I hope this application can help small time freelancers and others.

I might use back end processes within this website if I see fit.

I had to pick and choose how complicated I wanted to make this application. To complete an entire tax projection application is extremely complicated and would
have taken me forever. The US tax code is extremely complicated. I had to balance time versus complexity in building my application. Sounds like a Big O Notation 
problem (a little coding joke)...

## Disclosure: 

Although I do believe this tax projection to be accurate and I have tested for bugs do not rely upon this to estimate your own taxes. Taxes are complicated and this
projection does not include all tax scenarios. Please consult a tax advisor while using this application.

## What I used to create?
