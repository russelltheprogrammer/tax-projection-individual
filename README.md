# Link to Tax Projection Individual application --> This application is still in process. The link will be posted once it is completed.


## Overview 

This project was created to test my front end development skills at the next level. This project is the most complicated project I have attempted to date because of the massive amounts of state needed (REDUX will probably used) and the complexity of the US and NY tax code. Also, as I have built more and more applications there are more and more ideas and techniques to use, expanding my own ability to add more features and increase UI friendliness. I am excited to build this projection as it challenges me yet again. 

I plan to use this application to help individuals estimate their quarterly estimated taxes which is its main functionality. The US and NY tax codes are complex and not everyone can afford a high end tax accountant. I hope this application can help small time freelancers and others.

I might use back end processes within this website if I see fit.
