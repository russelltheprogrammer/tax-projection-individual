# Link to Tax Projection Individual application --> This application is still in process. The link will be posted once it is completed.


## Overview 

I created this application completely from scratch. I created the idea, the concept, and the user interface solely by myself. There was no tutorial, template, or boilerplate. 
I built it based on how a tax accountant and how a programmer think, trying to make the best UI experience for both. This project is impossible for just a tax accountant to build alone and it is impossible for just a programmer to build alone. One must have knowledge of both concepts to create this application.

This project was created to test my front end development skills at the next level. This project is the most complicated project I have attempted to date because of the massive amount of calculations and states needed(I used REDUX) and the complexity of the United States and New York tax codes. Also, as I have built more and more applications there are more and more ideas and techniques to use, expanding my own ability to add more features and increase UI friendliness. I am excited to build this projection as it challenges me yet again.

I plan to use this application to help individuals estimate their quarterly estimated taxes which is its main functionality. The United States and New York tax codes are complex and not everyone can afford a high end tax accountant. I hope this application can help small time freelancers and others.

I had to pick and choose how complicated I wanted to make this application. To complete an entire tax projection application with every little detail is extremely complicated and time consuming. The United states tax code is extremely complex. I had to balance time versus complexity in building my application. Sounds like a Big O Notation problem (a little coding joke)...

## More Features?

In the future, I plan to make a more advanced version of the application. However, I built this all by myself and I have limited time capacity. There are a lot of additional features I would have liked to add to make this application more accurate and more functional, including adding additional scenarios, more jurisdications, and the list goes on...

Feature requests? Please let me know.

## Disclosure: 

Although I do believe this tax projection to be accurate and I have tested it for bugs do not rely upon this to estimate your own taxes. Taxes are complicated and this projection does not include all tax scenarios. Please consult a tax advisor while using this application.
