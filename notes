Things To Do

High Priority

debug tax calc function
change design
add routes for documentation, info, and contact

-need to add textAlign to navbar so it changes when list items dissappear -> IconButton -> Typography
-Icon Button sx how to change when icon shows but how to add JS when you click on button when larger than xs? It has something to do with mobile responsiveness I think.

Low Priority

Hide Total State Other rows when not in use
Refactor NumbersOuputWithTax Component section with payments
Refactor capital gains calculation into its own function outside of regular tax calculation function


More features? See notes outside of github.


Items that change per year and which need to be updated in the constants
